# 👋 Hi, I'm mec-nyan!

I've been programming professionally since 2021. I did a little bit of full-stack development at first and for the last two years I've been providing backend solutions in Go.

## 🌟 About me

- 🐧 GNU+Linux fan (debian is my favourite distro and I think other distros are awesome too)
- 📚 Currently learning a lot about Go and modern design patterns.
- 💻 Familiar with Go, Python, Lua, Bash, C and C++.
- 🔧 Preferred development environment: Vim/Neovim + gnome-terminal/Kitty + awesomewm/i3/sway
- λ  Love maths and esoteric programming languages (I'm looking forward to learn Rust and Haskell)
- 🌸 Learning Japanese, hope to travel one day.
